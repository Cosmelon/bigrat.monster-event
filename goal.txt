This is an event made for the purpose of running a minecraft event the way that we, normal minecraft players would run it.
In recent years, Minecraft tournaments ("events") have attracted popularity as some of the most exclusive and unique events in the community.
However, since these events are often livestreamed by large content creators, that leaves little space for the common player.
We aim to change that.

Six games, one event.

Games included: Spleef, Race, Survival Games, Block Party, Diggy (fossilDig), TNTBlast
