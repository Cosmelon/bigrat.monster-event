This folder is for the TNTBlast game

That name is subject to change btw I came up with this while I was in class.

I comissioned a plugin for this game on Fiverr, and I've tested it out in the sgDevServer, it works great.
    I have to use the config file for that plugin, where I list all the blocks I want to be destroyed
    </tntblock on> turns it on
    </tntblock off> turns it off
    <tntblock.command> is the permission required to use it

Basically, the concept of this game is based on that the players are all in an arena and are trying to kill each other with tnt blocks.
I still need to find a way to make tnt auto ignite, but I'm confident that I can do it.
