For the most part, blockparty uses the ? differenciator infront of all the vars

also bptick.mcfunction is just going to be like that where it's throwing out that error
    it thinks that it is a syntax error b/c the sound used isn't a default MC sound
    either way, it has been resolved


When /startbp is run, all users are teleported to the arena.
The players are spread out in a circle using differential TP looking at an armor stand while Admin and Spectator are sent to the dead area.
Blockparty is different from the other games because /gamemode spectator is never used, rather dead players are just removed from the game floor

?stop bpTimer is the most important score for this game as it controls the clock and many conditions are dependant on it.
The start countdown system is very similar to the other games.
RNG systems for BP are really complicated -- will be fixed in the future, just not yet.
