# DIGGY DIGGY HOLE
# so basically its a fossil digging type game where players are released into a prison mining pit and they have to find treasure
# in the pit and deposit it at the top and they would only have a certain amount of time before they got blindness because their
# flashlight ran out or something 
#  have a noteblock recreation of diggy diggy hole at the beginning
