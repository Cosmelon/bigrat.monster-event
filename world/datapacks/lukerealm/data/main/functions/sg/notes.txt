wants multiple rounds of sg, "2, maybe 3"
"i kind of wanna have 2 round but make it slightly more drawn out"
"but if you want skybattle pace then 3"
"but i feel like 2 fits sg more"
"chests will be talked about later, but i can signifiy locations when needed"

Need to look more into how loot tables work, I'm just not confident in my ability to do it rn.


This is just here for a bit idk where else to put it
[{"text":"Shrink ","color":"gold"},{"score":{"name":"~shrinkNum","objective":"sgBorder"},"color":"blue"},{"text":"/5 in 0:0","color":"gold"},{"score":{"name":"","objective":"sgBorder"}}]
