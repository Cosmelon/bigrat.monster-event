How Tomb is going to be structued:
 - cortex strategy -- will allow more flexible debugging
 - "just in time" method -- make objectives only when necessary and remove when unnecessary

Start function:
 - Acts as a *begin* type
 - teleports players to pregame lobby to explain what the game is



Issues:
 - multiple rounds can be run at once, wire up a game kill condition
 - make a function to skip the infotext intro
