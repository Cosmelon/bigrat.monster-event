The functions in this folder apply kits to users when they contact a kit NPC.
 - the time period in which they can do this is controlled -- when +rKActive tombCore == 1

As i write this, the items in each of the kits are just placeholders for now, and will remain so until offical kits have been balanced

In the future:
 - make a feature that will save the inventory spots that the players have sorted their items into
