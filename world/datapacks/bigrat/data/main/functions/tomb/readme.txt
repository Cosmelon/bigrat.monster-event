This is a PvE came that I don't understand how it works as I write this.

round 1 - players are set into a medium sized map with the goal to kill as many mobs as possible
    - teams are rewarded based off of position on how many mobs killed
    - first round has a time limit (2.5 mins)
    - team with most kills get the most points

round 2 - players are set into a smaller sized map having to defeat 3 waves of mobs
    - then moving onto a medium sized map where they have to do the same thing, then to a larger sized map
    - teams are rewarded based off of position of finishing all 9 waves
    - points will be handed out giving first team to finish all 3 rooms to last team finish all 3 rooms
    - 

round 3
    - ???

players will be introduced to 4 kits before round 1 starts that they will use all 3 rounds -
gladiator: heavy dps but bad armor
bulk: low dps lot of armor
medic: pretty much a healer with a cooldown of 5-15 seconds for a shnasty heal pot (still debating)
hunter: bow based kit, avoid any sort of effect arrows though because of 3rd round (however maybe add poison arrows during 1st and 2nd round

4 kits for players to choose from -- ONLY GET TO CHOOSE ONCE
 - warrior - heavy damage, light armor
 - tank - heavy armor, light damage
 - medic - health stuff every 15sec
 - hunter - bow based stuf
only way to confirm kit is by leaving thru tunnel


3rd round is NOT going to have infinite respawns --
1st will have infinite respawns
    ???? 2nd and 3rd might share limited respawns



End of game:
    rewarding top kills like BW
