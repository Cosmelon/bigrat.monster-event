Spleef info

TL;DR: 
Gameplay: spleef with snowballs, players get +1 snowball per snow block they mine. throwing a snowball at a snow block breaks it
Shrinks: 3 shrinks: 1st at 95s, 2nd at 170s, 3rd at 250s. Each takes 20 seconds and is given a 30 second warning before

As I'm writing this out, I realize how bad the spleef code looks, gonna get that lookin cleaner soon
