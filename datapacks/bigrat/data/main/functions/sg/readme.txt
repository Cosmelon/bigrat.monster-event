Survival Games! First it's the classic Hunger Games minigame then it's the remixed superpowers mode!

Unfortunately, as of 29/06/22, Survival Games has stopped development and is postponed indefinitely. It's very likely I will never finish it.

The codebase is outdated and it really hurts to look at it, and in the interest of finishing this event on time, I don't want to work on it anymore.
Thanks to the builders: fruitlukes and Solawr for helping me build what we could of the arena. You dudes are awesome sauce.


I asked the testers for some last words:
- "fuck you." -Solawr
- "lud7... you will be missed as a game and hated for being hard to develop" -oGarfield
- "posture check" -LendKaru
