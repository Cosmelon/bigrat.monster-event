I designed each game to have their own start, kill, and tick functions. Each are self-explantory. But each game's tick file is only active when that game is active. Originally, I designed each tick file to always be running, but this became inefficient for the code and it looked terrible.


Spleef:
- start: main:spleef/startspleef
- tick: main:spleef/sptick
- kill: main:spleef/killspleef
- For the most part, it's classic Spleef. 3 rounds with 3 border shrinks
- But if you break a snowblock with the shovel, you get given one snowball per block, throwing these at a snow_block breaks it
- You also have a knockback stick called "Bastard Blaster" that you can use to hit other players across the map
- specifics:
    - Currently I have all the timers set to start when main:spleef/startspleef is initally ran, I'll probably fix this in the future
    - Players are given tools 22 seconds after main:spleef/startspleef is ran
    - During a border shrink, snow blocks are proceedurally destroyed after the border encases them
    - As I write this, spleef is "mostly complete"

Race:
- start: main:race/startrace
- tick: main:race/racetick
- kill: main:race/killrace
- Classic foot race type game
- Players are given water breathing 1, speed 1, and weakness 1
- There are six checkpoints that the player has to hit to make sure they don't skip the course
- In the first area, I made a little gate that is open for five seconds, then is replaced to be closed for two seconds
- I designed the various effects to be as modular as possible so the course builders can place effect zones easily
- Specifics:
    - speedpads are magenta_glazed_terracotta
    - jump boost pads are lime_glazed_terracotta
    - elytra pads are light_blue_glazed_terracotta

Survival Games:
- start: main:sg/startsg
- tick: main:sg/sgtick
- kill: main:sg/killsg
- Classic Survival Games game
- I made four different tiers of custom loot tables for the chests, where each tier is located is constant, but is randomized each game
- Five border shrinks per round, two rounds total
- Round two is the superpowers mode with eight different powers selected at random

Block Party:
- start: main:blockparty/start
- tick: main:blockparty/bptick
- kill: main:blockparty/killbp
- there are 30 randomly generated patterns with 8 colors, unfortunately they're all pre-generated by worldedit and imported as structures
- stand on the selected block to survive when the music stops
- I had the most trouble with this game by far
- I want this game to use a spectator system similar to dodgebolt in that gamemode=spectator isn't used
    - rather I want to make it so that the admins/spectators see it from the side of the map

Diggy:
- randomly generated fossils and the players have to dig them up

TNTBlast:
- not much idea on what this game is going to be yet, we're still arguing about it
