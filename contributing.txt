Now that more people are going to work on this, I should probably standardize some formats

Adding a new feature:
    - create a branch with a relevant name
    - push it and it will be uploaded to the main server via GitHub Action

function template:
    # <function name and author>
    # <description>
    # <who the function effects>
    # <where the function runs from>

Global functions are located in main:
Game-specific functions go in their own folder (ex: blockparty goes in main:blockparty/)

scoreboard objectives and tags should be in the format <game>UpperCamelCase
dummy scores are in the format <prefix>lowerCamelCase
"boolean" scores follow the value: 1 = on, 0 = off
