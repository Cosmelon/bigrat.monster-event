Now that more people are going to work on this, I should probably standardize some formats

Adding a new feature:
    - create a branch with a relevant name
    - push it and it will be uploaded to the main server via GitHub Action

Some basic documentation
    - 4 player teams + Admin & Spectator
    - all players on teams Red, Blue, Green, Yellow have the 'player' tag
    - users with 'admin' tag can see specific debug messages in chat
    - main:telemenu is the admin teleport panel, accessible with /op only
    - all gametick functions are run from main:tick but are only active when their gameActive score == 1
    - to return to the lobby, just use main:returnlobby in your win function and add specifics to main:lobby
    - .<score> sb_scoreboard should be the format internal variables should be stored with
    - individual game scoreboard objectives should be created when the game starts, erased when lobby is called
        - these should also be named as <2 letter gamecode>_<descriptor>

    - in elimination-based games, the start function must first check if .validPlay br_tcheck matches 1, 
        otherwise game will loop uncontrollably
    
    br_bigrat (global/lobby)
    sp_spleef
    rc_race
    sg_survivalgames
    bp_blockparty
    tb_tomb
    hl_halls (backrooms)

function template:
# Description:
# Author:
# Type: <tick><win><math><kill><start><single>
# @s = <executor> (can be omitted when not used)
# run from 

# template for infotext, it's messy as hell but it should work with most differing chat sizes

tick type is for a function that runs every tick at anytime regardless if it's always active
single type is for a function that only runs once

Global functions are located in main:
Game-specific functions go in their own folder (ex: blockparty goes in main:blockparty/)

"boolean" scores follow the value: 1 = on, 0 = off
